IPChecker is a simple program that is used to connect ones network address to a webhook for discord. 
This allows people that host there own servers to have a way to people they want in a discord channel if the servers IP changes.

Why does it have file encryption?.. I dont know... I was bored it looked intresting and now it makes sqwiggly lines in the txt file!

Saves the Webhook, message and IPAddress to your documents under Discord IP.
